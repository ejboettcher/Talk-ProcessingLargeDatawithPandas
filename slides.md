-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Motivation
Data sets can get large quickly.  
You can quickly go from looking at a few 100 lines and a handful of columns to a million lines and hundred of columns.  

Luckily, we live in a time where most people have laptops with processing power 
that would have made the engineers who put a man on the moon swoon. 
At the very least, doubt it would be possible to make.

<br/>

### But, you say,

#### "My data is BIG data, so I neeeed a better computer."
Well this talk is for you.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Brief History (small subset) of Large Data


As soon as there was paper and pen, 
<br/> there has been large data sets.

For example, in the 1600 Johannes Kepler used Tycho Brahe large data set on planet observations to prove how planets orbit the sun.  

<br/>

Unfortunately, he had to wait until Tycho Brahe died before he could get a hold of a large data set.  
<br/>



#### Some even thought he played a hand in Brahe's death

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Brief  History (small subset) of Large Data cont.

And in 1676 Ole Roemer (RÃ¸mer) armed with only paper, pencil, telescope and 
a wind up watch (which was not even good enough to navigate a ship with) 
calculated the speed of LIGHT within 30% by looking at Jupiter's moon Io.  

(NOTE: prior to this people thought that light was instantaneous!  
His prediction for Io was off by a few minutes.)

![pen](./images/pen.jpeg)


 <br/>
 
#### Only equipment needed to measure speed of light
<br/>

-------

## Measuring the Speed of Light

This required LOTS of observations over years and years by multiple people.  

Since Romer was not trying to calculate the speed of light at the time, 
but when Io would have an eclipse, 
he must have had to recalculate he calculations over and over again
by hand to ensure there was not a mistake in the math or observations.

<br/>

### Roemer's Conclusion

My work is correct, the timing is off because light moves at a finite speed.  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Brief of History (small subset) of Large Data cont..

We have it a bit easier, <br/> we only having to deal with:

* NaNs: Not A Number
* Slow downloads speeds

<br/>


### But, you say,
#### "My data is BIG and I want an answer today and not wait a decade."

<br/>

### Lets talk about the Python library Pandas.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Python Pandas

Python's Pandas is a high performance, easy to use library for analyzing structured
 data: csv files, json, SQLite etc.
<br/>

Pandas is fast, powerful and flexible. 
It enables you to quickly parse data. 
But, it is mainly designed to handle ~<100mb.  


<br/>


There are other tools like Spark to handle LARGE data sets 
(100 gigabytes to terabytes), but...

#### Pandas does an amazing job at cleaning messy / real data.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## How does one handle Large data with Pandas
When you have a gigabyte of real world data <br/>
and  you want to:

* Explore it
* Use your laptop and
* You don't want to switch to Spark.  

<br/>

### Step One:

Use old programming tricks like set numbers to 
***int8***, ***floats16***, or ***float32*** etc to 
reduce the memory size of your DataFrame.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Second Step: Use Categories

For numbers, try Int8, floats16 etc, but when you have strings that ***repeat***
SWITCH to

### categories

<br/>

### List of String Examples
#### Non repeating strings

```Python
string_list = ['Hello', 'World', 'More Strings', 'Evelyn','Boettcher']
```

#### Repeating String
Many times string data will be repetitive, like it will only contain days of week.

```Python
val_days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Monday', 
            'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Monday', 'Monday', 
            'Sunday']
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------

# Outline
### In this tutorial, we will:

* Learn how Python uses memory with Pandas
* How to reduce the Pandas' DataFrame memory footprint.
* Learn what data types are
* Speed up reading in csv files by using categories
* Reduce the memory footprint by 90%

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data Memory footprint

(sans overhead)

#### Numbers

|memory usage |	int|	uint | float | 	bool  |	  complex |
|:---:        |:----|:----   |:----  |:----|:----|
|1 bytes|	int8 (-128-127)| uint8 (0-255)||bool|  |
|2 bytes|	int16	 (-32768 to 32767)|uint16 (0 to 65535)|float16 (Half precision)	| |			   |
|4 bytes|		int32|	uint32 |	float32 (Single precision)|	|   |
|8 bytes	|	int64	|uint64 |float64 | |  complex64 (rep. by 2 32-bit floats) |

#### Strings
Python uses three kinds of internal representations for Unicode strings:

* 1 byte per char (Latin-1 encoding)
* 2 bytes per char (UCS-2 encoding)
* 4 bytes per char (UCS-4 encoding)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## How does categories work?

Pandas category type uses integer values to map to the raw values in a column.  
<br/>

This mapping is useful whenever a column contains a limited set of values.

So instead of writing
#### df.mydays = ["Sunday", "Sunday", "Sunday"]

<br/>
Pandas categories says

#### Sunday = 1

and the DataFrame **in memory** is effectively now

#### df.mydays = [1, 1, 1]

-------

## How does categories work?
![Python Categories](./images/numpy_vs_python.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Convert to Categories
To convert a column to the category we set the data type (dtype).

```Python
df['column name'].astype('category')
```

![SundaySunday df](./images/SundaySunday.png)

<br/>

### But wait..

Converting to categories is not always helpful.
<br/>

The following examples will show the power and pitfalls of categories


-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interactive Part
### Large Data: Numbers

* Open a terminal then go to the folder where this tutorial has been downloaded, type the following

```bash
cd src
```

then type.

```bash
python int_floats_cats.py
```
<br/>


```bash
Building three DF with:
     range of numbers 1- 4
     length of DF  10000
Top 10 rows of data
   INT  INT8     FLOAT
1    2     4  3.329446
2    2     4  1.478631

____________________
Now lets make them into categories
INT  df (plain df, category, SAVINGS)---> 0.0764MB , 0.0098MB , 87 %
INT8 df (plain df, category, SAVINGS)---> 0.0096MB , 0.0098MB , -2 %
___NOTE______NOTE______NOTE______NOTE___
Categories reduced the size INT df!!
   BUT because of the overhead
   it did not reduce the int8 size

Now, lets try this with random Floats
Float         --->  0.0764MB
Float category--->  0.4079MB
Categories only made the DF memory use worse



.
```

### Reduced Frequency of Numbers in DF
Let's try it again but reduce the frequency (e.g. Numbers repeat less) 
by increasing the range of number from r = 4 to r = 240.


```bash
python int_floats_cats.py -r 240
```

```Bash
Building three DF with:
     range of numbers 1- 240

## Large Data: Numbers cont..
### Increase SIZE

```bash
python int_floats_cats.py -r 4 -n 1000000
```

```Bash

```

-------------------------------------------------------------------
## Large Data: strings

So lets see how we can reduce size of STRINGS arrays.
If you have a column of strings that repeats, 
says days of week, states etc, then you may save memory 
if you switch to columns


```bash
python strings_cat.py
```

```Bash
Building three DF with:
     length of random string in a row 1- 4
     length of DF  10000
Top 10 rows of data
        Days  HELLO      Locations     Days_c HELLO_c    Locations_c Random_String
1    Tuesday  World    Beavercreek    Tuesday   World    Beavercreek          xhka
2  Wednesday  Hello        Oakwood  Wednesday   Hello        Oakwood          wiwh
3   Thursday  World      Fairfield   Thursday   World      Fairfield          gahf
4     Friday  Hello  Huber Heights     Friday   Hello  Huber Heights          ldou
5   Saturday  World      Riverdale   Saturday   World      Riverdale          rynl

8    Tuesday  Hello        Oakwood    Tuesday   Hello        Oakwood          gjvs
9  Wednesday  World      Fairfield  Wednesday   World      Fairfield          nmwn
Getting size of the DF we just made
String NO Categories      2.6724MB
String WITH Categories    0.0306MB
Random String (1 column)  0.5818MB
____________________
Now lets make them all into categories
String Columns: HELLO, Locations, Days
NO CAT to category (plain df, category, SAVINGS)---> 2.6724MB , 0.0306MB , 98 %
Cat df to category (plain df, category, SAVINGS)---> 0.0306MB , 0.0306MB , 0 %
___NOTE______NOTE______NOTE______NOTE___

Now, lets try this with random STRINGS
String: Random         --->  0.5818MB
String: Random category--->  0.9068MB
Categories only made the DF memory use worse




.
```

----------
## Large Data: STRING
### Now, lets make this BIGGGG

```bash
python strings_cat.py -n 1000000 -r 4
```

#### Interesting Fact:

When we have a random string of characters of length 4 (26 char in the alphabet)
<br/>
    (e.g. 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 = 456,976) 
<br/>

Therefor over 1/2 of the strings should repeat!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

## Large Data: strings cont.

### SAVE DF  as `csv`

```bash
python strings_cat.py -n 10000000 -s 1 -r 6
```

This should produce a csv file called <br/>

* *My_Awesome.csv* with a size of 550.6MB and
* *My_Awesome_cat.csv* with size of 486.2

<br/>

### This may take a while.
Any questions so far?

## Read in...
 `My_Awesome_cat.csv` (Files size: ~486MB)

</br>

* Same data as My_Awesome.csv, but without the column of random strings

#### Now, read in the data and find all of the Sundays in the "Days" column

```bash
python read_awesome.py -r 0 -d Sunday
```

### With Categories!
```bash
python read_awesome.py -c 1 -r 0 -d Sunday
```

---------------------------------

#### WOW
The data in memory is **LESS** than the file size, by almost 90%!

## Questions?
* We created data that most *GUI* readers (Office Libre, Excel) can not read in.
* We reduced the size of data in memory to something LESS than the file size!
* Categories can be **Helpful** or **Hurtful** when we are dealing with large data.
   * Please use Pandas with care
